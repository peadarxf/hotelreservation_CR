# hotelreservation_CR
This is a hotel reservation programme I created for the Universidad Estatal a Distancia (UNED for short, San Jos√©, Costa Rica) tourism department.

My commission was to develop a low resource, easy-to-use electronic booking system for independent hotels and hostels in rural parts of Costa Rica. It was assumed that the user would not be particularly computer literate, and that their computer device would be several years old.

The user inputs the details of the reservation, the customer's name, their national ID (equivalent to social security number), hotel room condition, and each reservation is assigned a random serial number.

It is possible to print a summary of each reservation into a pdf file (stored in a local pdfs directory), and also the details of each reservation is stored into a local .csv file. If the csv file doesn't already exist a new one will be created.

It's definitely not very sophisticated but I think it's suitable for regular use for independent hoteliers.
